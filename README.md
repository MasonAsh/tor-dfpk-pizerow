# tor-vpin-pizerow

## TOR VPiN for the Raspberry Pi Zero W

This is a dockerized OpenWRT based image builder that prepares USB ethernet gadget mode.

Eventual stretch goal is to support an I2C based OLED + button hat for 2-factor auth and display of active wifi/tor connectivity.

This is a "client" of the tor-vpin deployed cloud infrastructure.
