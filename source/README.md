# Building from source

This [Dockerfile.source](Dockerfile.source) will build OpenWRT from the latest master branch from source.

It takes forever, which is why we're trying to leverage the image builder method in the parent tree.

This directory is kept around in case we decide to go down the build-from-source route in the future.
